This is the first project that i have done in Unity. It's Called Space and Time.

It's Space and Time but now its time for me to Rework it! I will try to create more clean codes. 
After finish my graduate project space and time i learned a lot things. 
I got workplace training and summer internship then i learned a lot things too.
With this i want to improve myself and also try to tidy this game as possible.

This project can have a lot bad codes. I know it. I will fix it slowly.
Its was my first project and everyone can have bad codes on their first project.  
I wont finish Space and Time fastly i will take it slow for make it perfect!

Also this game will have a story. We will see it when its done with perfection.
